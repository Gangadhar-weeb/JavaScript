-BigInt used for really bigIngeters eg: cryptography or mircosecond-precision

In js there is no char type like other langauages

Null Value:
    null value doesnot belong to above 
    In JS null is not reference to a non-existing object or null pointer like other langauages
    It just special value which represents "nothing" or "empty"

Undefine Value:
    -value is not assigned
    - if varaiable is declared but not assigned then its value is undefined
    - "while undefined is reserved as a default initial value for unassigned things"


-typeof null is object  (this is an error in the language, it’s not actually an object.)

-symbol for unique identifiers
-object for more complex data-structures
